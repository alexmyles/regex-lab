This is a test driven ruby lab designed to get you comfortable using RegEx in combination with the `.match` and `.scan` methods. Run `learn test` and build out your methods in regex_lab.rb

Hint: You can use <a href='https://rubular.com' title='Rubular'>rubular.com</a> as a handy tool to test your regular expressions as you write them.
